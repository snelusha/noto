noto (/n≈çto/, meaning "notebook" in Japanese) is a tool that generates commit messages for your Git projects. It analyzes your staged changes and uses Gemini to create clean, context-aware commit messages instantly.

## The Story Behind noto

noto was born from a simple need: keeping commit messages clean on university project with colleagues. As someone who values a well-maintained Git history, I built noto to make writing commit messages effortless and consistent. It worked so well that I decided to share it with the world.

## Why noto?

Writing good commit messages can be time-consuming and often gets overlooked. With noto, you can:

- Save time by generating commit messages automatically.
- Maintain a consistent style across your commits.
- Focus more on coding and less on writing messages.
- Leverage the power of Gemini for context-aware suggestions.

## Features

- One-command commit message generation

## How It Works

1. Stage your changes using `git add`
2. Run `noto commit` in your terminal
3. Review and edit the generated commit message if needed
4. Confirm the commit

noto is designed to integrate seamlessly into your Git workflow, making it easy to adopt without any hassle. Whether you're working on a solo project or collaborating with a team, noto helps you keep your commit history clean and informative.
