# Introduction

## What is noto?

noto (/n≈çto/, meaning "notebook" in Japanese) is a tool that generates commit messages for your Git projects. It analyzes your staged changes and uses Gemini to create clean, context-aware commit messages instantly.

## Why noto exists

Writing good commit messages is important but time-consuming. A clean Git history helps you understand your project's evolution, debug issues, and collaborate effectively. However, crafting meaningful commit messages for every change takes time away from actual coding.

I buit `noto` becuase I care deeply about maintaining clean Git trees, but I was spending too much time thinking through commit messages. Instead of choosing between quality and speed, I created a tool that delivers both.
