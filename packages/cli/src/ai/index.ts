Read the following repository commit history and, based on it, produce one complete, production-ready prompt file written in Markdown that can be used to send to an LLM to generate commit messages from a git diff. Your sole output must be this final Markdown prompt file and nothing else.

        From the history, infer the house style as precisely as possible: how scopes are written, typical subject length, capitalization and punctuation rules (including whether subjects end with a period), whether emoji are used and where, the preferred tense and voice, how often bodies are included and whether they’re paragraphs or bullets (and what bullet marker is used), the usual line-wrapping width (default to 72 if unclear), and the exact footer formats for items like references (e.g., “Fixes #123”, “Refs #456”), breaking changes, co-authors, or signatures. When the history is inconsistent, prefer the most recent conventions and make clear, explicit defaults for anything the history does not establish.
