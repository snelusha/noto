# Commit Message Guidelines

## Format

Use conventional commits: `type: description`

## Style Rules

- **Tense**: Imperative/present ("allow", "generate", "use", "add", "remove", "merge")
- **Capitalization**: Lowercase first letter
- **Length**: Concise, typically under 70 characters
- **Tone**: Technical and straightforward

## Commit Types

- `feat`: New features or functionality.
- `fix`: Bug fixes or issue resolutions.
- `docs`: Documentation updates.
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, or tooling changes.

## Scope Usage

No scopes used

## Description Patterns

Start with an imperative verb. Describe the action taken. Be specific about what was changed or added. Use backticks for code snippets.

## Examples from History
